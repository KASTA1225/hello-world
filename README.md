Hi everyone!

I am Kyle and I am an MIS major! Current hobbies include playing the trombone, going to the gym, and doing movie nights! When I'm not inside doing those things or schoolwork I am out exploring nature and going on hikes. I also like to bike (I need to get my bike ready for summer though haha.) What I learned about MIS is that data is extremely complicated to handle yet so simple to write out after a while. Command lines become breezy to type out yet a single mistake anywhere can take down the entire code and the website with it. Doing spreadsheets is also a lot more complicated and not easy to do which is something I didn't realize when I switched to this major. I guess I could call it a business tech degree since there's a bunch of coding going on behind the excel spreadsheets. I should be a lot more adapted to this but clearly I still need more time to get adjusted to sitting behind a computer all day.
